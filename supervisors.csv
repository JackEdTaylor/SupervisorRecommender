Do you know the Stoop test? The game where you have to name the colour of the ink a word is written by? The trick is that the word is actually the name of a colour, which creates interference. In my research, I am interested in the relationship between attention and cognitive control by using tasks similar to the Stroop test. Specifically, the idea is to trigger cognitive conflict and look for improvements in performance, by measurements of behaviour, EEG and self-report."
