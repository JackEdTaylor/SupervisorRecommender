Manuela,Ruzzoli,"attention, cognitive control, cognitive conflict, multimodal perception","behavioural methods, EEG, self-report questionnaires",https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/staff/manuelaruzzoli/,http://www.gla.ac.uk/0t4/psychology/images/staffprofiles/staffphoto.html?id=4edfecec8691,"Hi, I am Manuela and I am a Research fellow at the CCNi. Do you know the Stoop test? The game where you have to name the colour of the ink a word is written by? The trick is that the word is actually the name of a colour, which creates interference. In my research, I am interested in the relationship between attention and cognitive control by using tasks similar to the Stroop test. Specifically, the idea is to trigger cognitive conflict and look for improvements in performance, by measurements of behaviour, EEG and self-report."
Rachael,Jack,"face perception (social), face perception (cross cultural), social robotics","computational modeling, reverse correlation, behavioural methods",https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychology/staff/rachaeljack/,https://www.gla.ac.uk/0t4/psychology/images/staffprofiles/staffphoto.html?id=4fdcedec8397,"Rachael Jack is a Reader (Associate Prof) in the School of Psychology. Her research has produced significant advances in understanding facial expression of emotion within and across cultures using a novel interdisciplinary approach that combines psychophysics, social psychology, dynamic 3D computer graphics, and mathematical psychology. Most notably, she has revealed cultural specificities in facial expressions of emotion; that four, not six, expressive patterns are common across cultures; and that facial expressions transmit information in a hierarchical structure over time. Together, Jack's work has challenged the dominant view that six basic facial expressions of emotion are universal, which has led to a new theoretical framework of facial expression communication that she is now transferring to digital agents to synthesize culturally sensitive social avatars and robots. Jack's work has featured in several high-profile scientific outlets (e.g., Annual Review of Psychology, Current Biology, Psychological Science, PNAS, TICS). She is currently funded by the European Research Council (ERC) to lead the research program Computing the Face Syntax of Social Face Signals, which will deliver a formal model of human social face signalling with transference to social robotics. Jack is recipient of the American Psychological Association (APA) New Investigator award, the Social and Affective Neuroscience Society (SANS) Innovation award, the British Psychological Society (BPS) Spearman Medal, Association for Psychological Science (APS) Rising Star award, and International Society for Research on Emotion (ISRE), Young Researcher Spotlight. She is also Associate Editor at Journal of Experimental Psychology: General and the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, and on the Editorial Boards of Psychological Science and Affective Science. She also serves various roles on the committees/boards for the conferences of the Society for Affective Sciences (SAS), IEEE Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition (FG), and the Vision Science Society (VSS)."
Dale,Barr,"language production, language comprehension, perspective taking, collective memory, collective decision making, social network effects and cultural evolution, nonverbal communication, joint action","data analysis in R, computational simulation, computational modeling, linear mixed-effects modelling, multi-agent simulation, eye-tracking, EEG",https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/staff/dalebarr/,http://www.gla.ac.uk/0t4/psychology/images/staffprofiles/staffphoto.html?id=4cdcede78193,"Dale Barr's primary research is in the area of the psychology of communication and social interaction. His work examines the cognitive representations and processes that underlie successful social interaction and communication. One line of work uses visual-world eyetracking and EEG to investigate how people integrate contextual knowledge (such as knowledge about a speaker's beliefs and intentions) during real-time spoken language comprehension. Another line investigates how memory shapes the generation of spoken descriptions. He has also published projects on multimodal communication and cultural evolution, and has a secondary interest in statistical modeling, with a focus on mixed-effects modeling and time-series analysis. <a href=""https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=QYsBt00AAAAJ&hl=en"">Click here</a> for a list of publications."
